# Usage

There are only two commands: `serve` and `build`. You would run `serve` when working on your website locally and you would run `build` to generate static files to be deployed to production.

## Serve

Running `serve` will start a live-reloading development server for local development. You run it with:

```shell
❯ charge serve <source directory>
```

`<source directory>` is the directory that contains the files you want to be built to become your static site.

They’ll be automatically built to `tmp/target`. You might want to add `tmp/target` to your `.gitignore` file or however you exclude files from version control.

### Live-reloading

Charge uses the popular [Browsersync][browsersync] library to handle live-reloading. Unfortunately, the documentation is not particularly clear about the details of how live-reloading works or what to expect. Here’s how I think it works:

If a stylesheet changes it will be live-reloaded. That is, it will be injected into the page without a full-page refresh. If an image changes it will also be live-reloaded.

If a JavaScript file changes it will do a full-page refresh. If an HTML file changes it will also do a full-page refresh. Basically, if anything other than a stylesheet or image changes it will do a full-page refresh.

If you encounter a file type that doesn’t appear to reload how you would expect, open an issue!

## Build

Running `build` will do a single build of your static site to create files to be deployed to production. You run it with:

```shell
❯ charge build <source directory> <target directory>
```

`<source directory>` is the directory that contains the files you want to be built to become your static site and `<target directory>` is the directory you want the static site to end up in.

## Scripts

Rather than typing `charge serve` or `charge build` followed by the source and target directory over and over again, consider adding the following scripts to your `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "charge serve source",
    "deploy": "charge build source target && <deploy command here>"
  }
}
```

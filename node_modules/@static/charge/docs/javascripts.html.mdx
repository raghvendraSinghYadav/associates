# JavaScripts

JavaScripts are transformed using [Babel][babel].

## Features

All features from `es2015`, `es2016`, and `es2017` are included via [`@babel/preset-env`][babel-preset-env]. You can see a list of those features in the [ECMAScript compatibility table][ecmascript-compatibility-table].

## Importing

You can import other JavaScripts using the ES6 module syntax.

```javascript
// index.js
import something from "./other.js"

console.log(something)
```

```js
// other.js
export default "something"
```

Imported JavaScripts will be treated as dependencies and inlined into the files that import them.

Make sure you reference dependencies relatively with `./` or `../` to ensure theyâ€™re treated as dependencies.

### npm packages

You can `import` npm packages as you would normally expect. It will look for packages in the `node_modules` folder at the root of your project.

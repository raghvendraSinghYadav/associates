# Data files

Data files are a way of providing structured data to your pages in order to simplify building your site.

Data files are stored in a `data` folder that must be in the same directory as the `source` folder. Theyâ€™re siblings. So if the path to `source` is `some/folder/source`, then the path to `data` must be `some/folder/data`.

Data files are JSON files and the name of the file is the object property you use to access that data. So if you have a data file called `albums.json` then you would access the data from the `props` object passed into your page by calling `props.data.albums`.
